This is a blog about machines, deoxyribonucleic acids, clouds and all my mistakes.

I love R, python, shiny, ditto, docker, dplyr, ggplot2, git, jupyter, numpy, pikachu, pyspark, pytorch, ubuntu and whiscash. If you know which of those are pokemons, I love you too.

For more info about me, see [my personal page](http://simecek.github.io/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simecekpetr) and [a list of my publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=248ewekAAAAJ&hl=en).
